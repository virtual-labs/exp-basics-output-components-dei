## Procedure

1. Open the experiment in the virtual lab for basic output components.  
   The Arduino board and all output devices (RGB LED, 7-segment display, OLED, LCD 16x2, and buzzer) are already connected.

2. Observe the circuit connections.  
   Check how each output device is connected to the respective Arduino pins.  
   Identify the power pins, ground connections, and signal/control pins used for each module.

3. Open and study the Arduino code.  
   Review how pins are configured for output operation.  
   Understand the logic used to control color on RGB LED, numbers on 7-segment, characters on OLED/LCD, and tone generation on the buzzer.

4. Start the simulation.  
   Click the "Start Simulation" button in the interface.  
   Observe how each output device responds according to the code execution.  
   Check changes in LED color, displayed characters, numbers, or buzzer sounds.

5. Interact with the simulation if required.  
   Some components may respond based on internal timing or programmed sequences.  
   Note how output behavior changes based on code logic.

6. Record observations.  
   Note the output patterns on RGB LED, 7-segment display, LCD/OLED screens, and the sound patterns from the buzzer.

7. Stop the simulation.  
   Click the "Stop Simulation" button after completing the experiment.

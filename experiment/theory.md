## Output Components in Embedded Systems and IoT

Output components are devices that display information or respond to signals generated by a microcontroller.  
In this experiment, we study how common output devices can be interfaced and simulated using an Arduino Uno.  
These components convert electrical signals into visual, audio, or text-based outputs.  
The virtual lab environment allows users to interact with these devices without requiring physical hardware.

## RGB LED (Output – Light)

An RGB LED consists of three LEDs in one package: **Red, Green, and Blue**.  
By varying the intensity of each color, it can generate millions of color combinations.

### Working Principle

- Has four pins: **one common pin** (Common Anode or Common Cathode) and three color pins (R, G, B).  
- Arduino controls color intensity using **PWM signals** on digital pins.  
- The combination of PWM values creates different colors.

### Simulation Use

- Users can adjust PWM values to view **real-time color blending** in virtual labs.

### Applications

- Status indicators  
- Color coding  
- Decorative lighting  
- Visual feedback systems

## 7-Segment Display (Output – Numeric Display)

A 7-segment display is used to show digits from **0 to 9** using seven LED segments arranged in a specific pattern.

### Working Principle

- Each segment (**a–g**) is an LED controlled individually using Arduino pins.  
- Available in **Common Cathode (CC)** and **Common Anode (CA)** types.  
- By turning particular segments ON/OFF, any digit can be displayed.

### Simulation Use

- Arduino code controlling segments updates the digit instantly in simulation.

### Applications

- Digital clocks  
- Counters  
- Meters  
- Calculators  
- Measuring instruments

## OLED Display (Output – Graphical/Text Display)

An OLED (Organic LED) display can show both text and graphics with very high contrast.

### Working Principle

- Communicates with Arduino using the **I²C protocol** (SDA, SCL pins).  
- No backlight needed—each pixel emits its own light.  
- Uses libraries like **Adafruit SSD1306** to control display content.

### Simulation Use

- Users can simulate **text printing**, **animations**, and **graphics** easily.

### Applications

- Wearable devices  
- IoT dashboards  
- Portable gadgets  
- Sensor displays

## LCD 16×2 Display (Output – Text Display)

A **16×2 LCD** can display 16 characters per line across 2 lines.  
It uses the **HD44780 controller**, which has strong Arduino support.

### Working Principle

- Communicates via a **4-bit or 8-bit parallel interface**.  
- Arduino uses the **LiquidCrystal** library to send commands and characters.  
- Requires a **potentiometer** for contrast control.

### Simulation Use

- Virtual labs allow sending characters, commands, and even **custom characters**.

### Applications

- Home appliances  
- Embedded devices  
- Project displays  
- IoT interfaces  
- Digital meters

## Buzzer (Output – Sound)

A buzzer produces sound based on electrical signals provided by Arduino.

### Working Principle

- Can be:
  - **Active Buzzer:** Produces tone automatically when powered  
  - **Passive Buzzer:** Requires Arduino’s **tone()** function to generate sound  
- Produces beeps, alarms, or melodies depending on the frequency inputs.

### Simulation Use

- Simulation shows buzzer activity through **frequency indicators** or visual animations.

### Applications

- Alarms  
- Timers  
- Security systems  
- User alerts  
- Notification tones

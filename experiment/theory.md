Output components are devices that display information or respond to signals generated by a microcontroller. In this experiment, we study how common output devices can be interfaced and simulated using an Arduino Uno. These components convert electrical signals from Arduino into visual, audio, or display-based outputs. The virtual lab environment allows users to interact with these devices without requiring physical hardware.

# RGB LED (Output – Light)

An RGB LED consists of three LEDs in one package: Red, Green, and Blue.
By varying the intensity of each color, it can generate millions of color combinations.

## Working Principle

Has four pins: one common pin (Common Anode or Cathode) and three color pins (R, G, B).

Arduino controls color intensity using PWM signals on digital pins.

The combination of PWM values creates different colors.

## Simulation Use

In virtual labs, users can adjust PWM values to view color blending in real time.

## Applications

Status indicators, color coding, decorative lighting, and visual feedback systems.

# 7-Segment Display (Output – Numeric Display)

A 7-segment display is used to show digits from 0 to 9 using seven LED segments arranged in a specific pattern.

## Working Principle

Each segment (a–g) is an LED that can be turned on/off using Arduino pins.

Comes in Common Cathode or Common Anode types.

By controlling which segments are lit, any digit can be displayed.

## Simulation Use

Turning segments on/off through Arduino code makes the numeric digit appear instantly in simulation.

## Applications

Digital clocks, counters, meters, calculators, measuring instruments.

# OLED Display (Output – Graphical/Text Display)

An OLED (Organic LED) Display can show both text and graphics with very high contrast.

## Working Principle

Communicates with Arduino using I²C protocol (SDA, SCL pins).

Does not need a backlight because each pixel emits its own light.

Arduino uses libraries like Adafruit SSD1306 to control the display.

## Simulation Use

Users can simulate text printing, animations, and graphics on the OLED easily.

## Applications

Wearable devices, IoT dashboards, portable gadgets, sensor displays.

# LCD 16×2 Display (Output – Text Display)

A 16×2 LCD can display 16 characters per line across 2 lines.
It uses HD44780 controller, widely supported by Arduino.

## Working Principle

Communicates via 4-bit or 8-bit parallel interface.

Arduino uses the LiquidCrystal library to send commands and characters.

Requires a potentiometer for contrast adjustment.

## Simulation Use

The virtual lab allows sending characters, commands, and creating custom characters.

## Applications

Meters, embedded systems, home appliances, project displays, IoT interfaces.

# Buzzer (Output – Sound)

A buzzer produces sound based on the electrical signals provided by the Arduino.

## Working Principle

Can be Active (plays tone automatically) or Passive (requires frequency input).

Arduino uses the tone() function to generate different frequencies.

Produces beeps, alarms, or melodies depending on control signals.

## Simulation Use

In simulation, buzzer sounds are represented visually or with frequency indicators.

## Applications

Alarms, notifications, timers, security systems, user feedback.

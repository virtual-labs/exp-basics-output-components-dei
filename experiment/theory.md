1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to simulate and understand the interfacing of basic output components—RGB LED, 7-segment display, OLED display, 16×2 LCD display, and buzzer—with an Arduino microcontroller.
This experiment enables learners to understand how digital and analog signals from Arduino control visual and audio output devices.

2. Introduction
Output components are essential elements of embedded systems as they allow the system to communicate results to the user.
Arduino controls output devices by generating digital HIGH/LOW signals, PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) signals, or serial communication protocols such as I2C.
In this experiment, commonly used output devices are interfaced to demonstrate different output control techniques used in real-world embedded and IoT applications.
